# LS02B

The laser radar can be implemented within the scope of 4 meters 90 degrees of two-dimensional planar scanning, produce the space plane point cloud map information used to sweep the floor in areas such as robot and robot vision system.

LS02B lidar structure by using light large field of view Angle of the rotating scanning function, at the same time range is realized by using triangle principle.Its principle is: LS02B using cylindrical lens line laser emitting 90 degrees, the laser signal after exposure to the measured object surface reflection, 90 degrees of reflected light spot through the optical lens by LS02B image acquisition processing system receives, made parameters.the lasers and laser emission line geometry triangle graphics, based on the triangle, after LS02B of real-time signal processing module, the target object and LS02B radar distance, relative bearing Angle value and receive light intensity from the output of the communication interface.
